       " 'she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her',\n",
       " 'hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,',\n",
       " 'but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,',\n",
       " 'from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a',\n",
       " 'cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.',\n",
       " 'Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And',\n",

       " '“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”',\n",
       " '“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)',\n",
       " '“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole',\n",

       " '_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number',\n",
       " 'of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what',\n",
       " 'they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they',\n",

       " '“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice',\n",

       " 'There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I',\n",
       " 'wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the',\n",
       " 'roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and',\n",
       " 'Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”',\n",
       " '“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,',\n",
       " 'for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the',\n",
       " 'window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to',\n",
       " 'this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that',\n",

       " 'Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into',\n",

       " 'So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she',\n",

       " 'through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of',\n",
       " 'little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,',\n",
       " 'was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it',\n",

       " '“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she',\n",

       " 'An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and',\n",
       " 'feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little',\n",

       " 'spite of all her coaxing.',\n",
       " 'Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and',\n",
       " 'held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off',\n",
       " 'all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,',\n",

       " 'over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was',\n",
       " 'very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every',\n",

       " 'all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with',\n",
       " 'its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.',\n",
       " 'This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she',\n",

       " 'and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.',\n",
       " '“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant',\n",

       " '“Why?” said the Caterpillar.',\n",
       " 'Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any',\n",
